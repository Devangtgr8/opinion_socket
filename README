opinion_socket
==============

Purpose: To measure the student body's opinion on various issues, primarily
developed for use at IIT Mandi.

Each student is represented by their email address.

A poll consists of three data items: the title, description and form contents,
all of which will be stored in a single YAML file.

The results will also be stored in YAML files.

Whenever opinion is to be obtained for a new issue, all students will recieve
an email containing a link with a unique token, clicking on which will lead to
them being presented a page where they can cast their vote. Each unique token
can be used only once.
