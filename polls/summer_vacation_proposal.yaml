title: Summer Vacation Proposal
description: |
  <p>
  There is a proposal for increasing the number of days in the summer vacations
  by around two weeks. As each quiz in a semester takes 3 complete days. 
  Therefore, in a semester we have 6 days completely dedicated to quizzes with
  no class hours. Now, the proposal is to shift back to the former quiz pattern
  of having each quiz on a single day with regular commencement of classes; so 
  that these six days could be used as for vacation. Now, in this respect; two
  steps could be taken up:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>6 days of this semester could be put up together with winter vacations;
    which could add up to 12 weeks of winter break.</li>
    <li>12 days of two semesters could be put together with the summers; which
    could add up to close to 7 weeks of summer vacations. Decision over the 
    above points will be taken up later when students agree with this
    proposal.</li>
  </ol>
